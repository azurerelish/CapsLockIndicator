# CapsLockIndicator

CapsLockIndicator is a macOS menu bar application that displays HUD notifications whenever the Caps Lock key is toggled or the keyboard input source is changed. Inspired by Apple's typical HUD design, the app provides visual feedback for these events.

## Features

- **Input Source Change Detection:** Detect and notify when the keyboard input language is switched.
- **Menu Bar Integration:** Seamlessly integrates into the macOS menu bar with customizable preferences.
- **Customizable HUDs:** Options to enable or disable individual HUDs for Caps Lock and input source changes.
- **Accessibility:** Built-in checks and requests for accessibility permissions to ensure functionality.
